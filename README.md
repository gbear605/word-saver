# Word Saver

This extension saves words visited on WordReference (wordreference.com) and Wiktionary (wiktionary.org) to a text list. Currently only English and Swedish Wiktionary are supported.

This extension is not associated with WordReference or Wiktionary in any way.

Some code from https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/

## Usage

On a given page on WordReference or Wiktionary, the extension adds save buttons to various word definitions. Then, if you click the save button, the extension will add the word and its translation to the extension's list of saved words. 

Click on the extension's icon to see the list, which can then be copied and used for something else, such as making flashcards. From the extension page, you can also clear the list of words or edit it.

## Future Changes

* Add support for Polish, German, and Russian Wiktionary, bab.la, glosbe.com
* Add support for getting conjugations
