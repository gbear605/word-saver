# WordReference Saver

This extension saves words visited on WordReference (wordreference.com) to a text list.

This extension is not associated with WordReference in any way.

Some code from https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/

## Usage

Whenever a word is loaded on WordReference, the extension will add the word and its translation to the extension's list of saved words. Then, click on the extension's icon to see the list, which can then be copied and used for something else, such as flash card. From the extension page, you can clear the list of words or edit it.
